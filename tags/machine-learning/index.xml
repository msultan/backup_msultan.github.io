      <title>Kinase simulations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase&#34;&gt;Kinases&lt;/a&gt; are large family of protein found in a variety of cells that catalyze
the transfer of ATP&amp;rsquo;s gamma phosphate group to target substrate. They initiate and control a large number of
cellular pathways and are critical pharmaceutical targets. My research involves looking at the relationship between the
sequence and dynamics of these kinases. The fundamental question that I would like to answer is what happens to the
kinase&amp;rsquo;s underlying free energy landscape when its amino acid sequence is mutated, similar to mutations found in many
cancers.
To answer these questions, I am employing MD simulations combined with a new variation to MSMs which allows us to
explicitly compare the kinetics and thermodynamics of these mutants. I have simulated over 12 milliseconds in aggregate
data with three publications under preparation. These simulations are the largest set of kinase simulations
ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Sampling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in using MSM to extend the capability of MD simulations. The fundamental question I am
interested in answering if whether we can reduce the computational complexity of a new simulation by leveraging
information from the current MSM. The new simulation could be a new sequence, a new physics model or perhaps
some post translational modification. To that end, I am borrowing ideas from Reinforcement-Learning and Markov decision
processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I showed over &lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00182&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/02/158592&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;
 of papers that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msmbuilder.org/3.8.0/decomposition.html#tica&#34;&gt;tICA&lt;/a&gt; algorithm can be used to
form better CV than human intuition in enhanced sampling algorithms such as Metadynamics/Umbrella sampling. This is&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently interested in the problem of extending Markov state models to multiple sequences. The generic
question that I am trying to answer is how do we best compare the kinetics and thermodynamics of two differing
kinase sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
