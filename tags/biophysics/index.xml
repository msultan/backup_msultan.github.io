      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase&#34;&gt;Kinases&lt;/a&gt; are large family of protein found in a variety of cells that catalyze
the transfer of ATP&amp;rsquo;s gamma phosphate group to target substrate. They initiate and control a large number of
cellular pathways and are critical pharmaceutical targets. My research involves looking at the relationship between the
sequence and dynamics of these kinases. The fundamental question that I would like to answer is what happens to the
kinase&amp;rsquo;s underlying free energy landscape when its amino acid sequence is mutated, similar to mutations found in many
cancers.
To answer these questions, I am employing MD simulations combined with a new variation to MSMs which allows us to
explicitly compare the kinetics and thermodynamics of these mutants. I have simulated over 12 milliseconds in aggregate
data with three publications under preparation. These simulations are the largest set of kinase simulations
ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;
