I am current involved in the active development of several software packages related to
Markov modeling including [MSMbuilder](https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder), and
[Osprey](https://github.com/msmbuilder/osprey).
I also extensively use [our lab](pande.stanford.edu)'s distributed computing platform [Folding@home](http://foldingathome.stanford.edu/),
and am the first user of our [mobile client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing&hl=en).
