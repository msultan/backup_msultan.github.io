I have been interested in using MSM to extend the capability of MD simulations. The fundamental question I am
interested in answering if whether we can reduce the computational complexity of a new simulation by leveraging
information from the current MSM. The new simulation could be a new sequence, a new physics model or perhaps
some post translational modification. To that end, I am borrowing ideas from Reinforcement-Learning and Markov decision
processes.
