# Biography

Hi, I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Pande Group](www.pande.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](www.stanford.edu)
trying to understand protein Kinase dynamics using Molecular dynamics(MD) simulations and Markov state models(MSM).
I also work on methods to extend the interpretability of our models by borrowing techniques from statistics,
informatics, and machine learning. I am further interested in extending the capabilities of MD by leveraging
information from Markov models.

In my free time, I like to cook, hike, play squash, dabble in tennis, and do some light power lifting.
My current lifting best is a 470lbs squat, 520lbs deadlift, and 275lbs bench which equals to a
[Wilks coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilks_Coefficient) of 349.50.
