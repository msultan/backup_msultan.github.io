Protein allosteric pathways are investigated in the imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase heterodimer in an effort to
elucidate how the effector (PRFAR, N′-[(5′-phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide)
activates glutaminase catalysis at a distance of 25 Å from the glutamine-binding site. We apply solution NMR techniques
and community analysis of dynamical networks, based on mutual information of correlated protein motions in the active
and inactive enzymes. We find evidence that the allosteric pathways in the PRFAR bound enzyme involve conserved residues
that correlate motion of the PRFAR binding loop to motion at the protein-protein interface, and ultimately at the
glutaminase active site. The imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase bienzyme is an important branch point for the histidine
and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways and represents a potential therapeutic target against microbes. The proposed
allosteric mechanism and the underlying allosteric pathways provide fundamental insights for the design of new allosteric
drugs and/or alternative herbicides.
