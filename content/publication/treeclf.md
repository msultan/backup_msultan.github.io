 Given the large number of crystal structures and NMR ensembles that have been solved to date, classical molecular
 dynamics (MD) simulations have become powerful tools in the atomistic study of the kinetics and thermodynamics of
 biomolecular systems on ever increasing time scales. By virtue of the high-dimensional conformational state space
 that is explored, the interpretation of large-scale simulations faces difficulties not unlike those in the big data
 community. We address this challenge by introducing a method called clustering based feature selection (CB-FS) that
 employs a posterior analysis approach. It combines supervised machine learning (SML) and feature selection with Markov
 state models to automatically identify the relevant degrees of freedom that separate conformational states. We
 highlight the utility of the method in the evaluation of large-scale simulations and show that it can be used for
 the rapid and automated identification of relevant order parameters involved in the functional transitions of two
 exemplary cell-signaling proteins central to human disease states.
