The influence of electrostatic interactions on the free energy of proton coupled electron transfer in biomimetic
oxomanganese complexes inspired by the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) are investigated.
The reported study introduces an enhanced multiconformer continuum electrostatics (MCCE) model, parametrized at
the density functional theory (DFT) level with a classical valence model for the oxomanganese core. The calculated
pKa’s and oxidation midpoint potentials (Em’s) match experimental values for eight complexes, indicating that purely
 electrostatic contributions account for most of the observed couplings between deprotonation and oxidation state
 transitions.
