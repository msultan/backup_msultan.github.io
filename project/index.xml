      <title>Kinase simulations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase&#34;&gt;Kinases&lt;/a&gt; are large family of protein found in a variety of cells that catalyze
the transfer of ATP&amp;rsquo;s gamma phosphate group to target substrate. They initiate and control a large number of
cellular pathways and are critical pharmaceutical targets. My research involves looking at the relationship between the
sequence and dynamics of these kinases. The fundamental question that I would like to answer is what happens to the
kinase&amp;rsquo;s underlying free energy landscape when its amino acid sequence is mutated, similar to mutations found in many
cancers.
To answer these questions, I am employing MD simulations combined with a new variation to MSMs which allows us to
explicitly compare the kinetics and thermodynamics of these mutants. I have simulated over 12 milliseconds in aggregate
data with three publications under preparation. These simulations are the largest set of kinase simulations
ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am current involved in the active development of several software packages related to
Markov modeling including &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder&#34;&gt;MSMbuilder&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/msmbuilder/osprey&#34;&gt;Osprey&lt;/a&gt;.
I also extensively use &lt;a href=&#34;pande.stanford.edu&#34;&gt;our lab&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s distributed computing platform &lt;a href=&#34;http://foldingathome.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;Folding@home&lt;/a&gt;,
and am the first user of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;mobile client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in using MSM to extend the capability of MD simulations. The fundamental question I am
interested in answering if whether we can reduce the computational complexity of a new simulation by leveraging
information from the current MSM. The new simulation could be a new sequence, a new physics model or perhaps
some post translational modification. To that end, I am borrowing ideas from Reinforcement-Learning and Markov decision
processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently interested in the problem of extending Markov state models to multiple sequences. The generic
question that I am trying to answer is how do we best compare the kinetics and thermodynamics of two differing
kinase sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
